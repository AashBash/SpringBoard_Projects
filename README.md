# SpringBoard Projects

A curated portfolio of analytics and data science case studies showcasing exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, machine learning techniques, SQL tasks, and storytelling with data.

## Repository overview
This repository houses a collection of projects completed during my Springboard Data Science bootcamp. It includes:
- Supervised machine learning: regression, classification, gradient boosting
- Unsupervised learning: k-means clustering
- Statistical inference & Bayesian analysis
- SQL querying and data wrangling
- API data extraction and analysis
- Data storytelling and visualizations using Tableau
